    "Here, the mapper receives its set of input splits either from the transaction table or from the countries table and makes the appropriate transformations: splitting the line into fields, and emitting a key/value. The key is the join key - in this case, the country code field of both sets of records. The mapper knows which file and type of record it is receiving based on the length of the fields. The records it emits contain the join field as the key, which acts as the partitioning key; We use the SORT_VALUES option, which ensures the values are sorted as well. Then, we employ a trick to ensure that for each join key, country records are seen always before transaction records. We achieve this by adding an arbitrary key to the front of the value: 'A' for countries, 'B' for customers. This makes countries sort before customers for each and every join/partition key. After that trick, the join is simply a matter of storing countries ('A' records) and crossing this array with each customer record."
