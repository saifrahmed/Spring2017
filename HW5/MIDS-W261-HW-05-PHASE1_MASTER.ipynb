    "Data warehousing emphasizes the capture of data from diverse sources for useful analysis and access, but does not generally start from the point-of-view of the end user who may need access to specialized, sometimes local databases. The latter idea is known as the data mart.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to data warehousing, top down and bottom up. The top down approach spins off data marts for specific groups of users after the complete data warehouse has been created. The bottom up approach builds the data marts first and then combines them into a single, all-encompassing data warehouse.<span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">&quot;</span>   \n",

    "<span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">&quot;</span>The star schema is the simplest style of data mart schema and is the approach most widely used to develop data warehouses and dimensional data marts. The star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries.   \n",

    "\n",
    "- __Simpler queries__ - star schema join logic is generally simpler than the join logic required to retrieve data from a highly normalized transactional schemas.\n",
    "- __Simplified business reporting logic__ - when compared to highly normalized schemas, the star schema simplifies common business reporting logic, such as period-over-period and as-of reporting.\n",
    "- __Query performance gains__ - star schemas can provide performance enhancements for read-only reporting applications when compared to highly normalized schemas.\n",
    "- __Fast aggregations__ - the simpler queries against a star schema can result in improved performance for aggregation operations.\n",
    "- __Feeding cubes__ - star schemas are used by all OLAP systems to build proprietary OLAP cubes efficiently; in fact, most major OLAP systems provide a ROLAP mode of operation which can use a star schema directly as a source without building a proprietary cube structure.<span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">&quot;</span>   \n",

Additionally, given the distributed and sequential nature of the MapReduce framework that supports most of modern ML at scale, denormalized log data has the representational redundancy that would permit the processing of the data in a parallel fashion.\n",

    "The following MRJob code, implements a reduce-side join for an inner join. The reducer is almost stateless, i.e., uses as little memory as possible. Use the tables from HW5.2 for this HW and join based on the country code (third column of the transactions table and the second column of the Countries table perform.

    "__Some notes on the code__ \n",
    "Here, the mapper receives its set of input splits either from the transaction table or from the countries table and makes the appropriate transformations: splitting the line into fields, and emitting a key/value. The key is the join key - in this case, the country code field of both sets of records. The mapper knows which file and type of record it is receiving based on the length of the fields. The records it emits contain the join field as the key, which acts as the partitioning key; We use the SORT_VALUES option, which ensures the values are sorted as well. Then, we employ a trick to ensure that for each join key, country records are seen always before transaction records. We achieve this by adding an arbitrary key to the front of the value: 'A' for countries, 'B' for customers. This makes countries sort before customers for each and every join/partition key. After that trick, the join is simply a matter of storing countries ('A' records) and crossing this array with each customer record."
